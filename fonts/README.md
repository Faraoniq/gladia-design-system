## Required files

| File                        | Weight | Used for           |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------------------|
| SuisseIntl-Regular.woff2    | 400    | Body, bento titles |
| SuisseIntl-Book.woff2       | 450    | Buttons (md)       |
| SuisseIntl-Medium.woff2     | 500    | Hero h1, buttons   |
| SuisseIntl-SemiBold.woff2   | 600    | Section titles     |

`.woff` versions are optional but recommended for broader support.

If you don't have the Book weight (450), duplicate Regular — the browser will synthesize it.

Inter (Google Fonts) is loaded as a fallback and will render until these files are present.
